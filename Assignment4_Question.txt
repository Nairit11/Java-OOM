Assignment 4

You are given the roll numbers and list of courses for n students. Also you are given the roll
numbers of t students. Print their CGPA (till 1st place of decimal). Note that you must minimally
implement a batch class that stores an array of students, a student class and a course class.
Input Format
The first line is n, the number of students. For each student, the first line of input is roll number
and then the number of courses for that student, m. Thereafter there are multiple lines, mentioning
the course code and grade of the student in the course, each on separate lines.
The roll number is of the form ABC201NXYZ, where ABC is either IIT, LIT, ITM, BIM, ICM,
ISM, IIM, IHM, IRM or IWM. N is either 6, 5, 4 or 3. XYZ is a number between 000 and 199. If
a roll number is wrongly entered at this stage, the message “Incorrect Roll Number” is printed and
the user needs to re-enter, till entered correctly.
The course code is of the form DXYZABCT, where D is I, E, S or M. XYZ are all capital alphabets.
A is a digit from 1 to 9. B is a digit from 0 to 3. C is a digit from 0 to 3. T is either C or E. If a

course code is incorrect, the message “Wrong Course Code” is printed and the user needs to re-
enter till entered correctly. The course credits are B+C. Unlike the current system, it is assumed

that the lab and theory have the same grades.
The grade can be A+, A, B+, B, C, D, E, F and I. Only the first 6 grades are pass grades. If a grade
is wrongly entered, the message “Illegal Grade” is printed and the user needs to re-enter, till entered
correctly.
For n students enter the roll number (format & list given), n courses (list and format), grades (A to
D only), credits (2 to 5 only), calculate CGPA. All retry.
The next input is t, the number of queries, followed by t lines, each mentioning the roll number. If
the roll number exists, the CGPA is printed on the screen, else the message “Roll Number not
found” is printed on the screen.
All error messages must be handled as user defined exceptions. Make separate user defined
exceptions for all types. All exceptions must be triggered at the constructors/setters of the most
suitable class and not when taking the inputs.
