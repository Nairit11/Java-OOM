Assignment 5

1) Consider question 1 of assignment 2 (The Convocation). Make a GUI to take input, keeping the
data model the same as before. After all inputs are taken, display the details of all students using a
suitable GUI. The display GUI should have a left and right button to iterate through students, a
search bar to find details of a desired student, a modify button to correct any detail, an add button
to add more data, and a delete button to delete a record. Illegal inputs that do not match the format
should come as popups.
2) Consider a drawing app wherein a user fixes a color and a size. On clicking a square of the fixed
size and color is drawn on the screen. After clicking the last drawn square can be moved on the
screen using the arrow keys. Please ensure that the data and GUI is as separate as possible in
separate classes. You must first make a good class diagram and then implement the question.
